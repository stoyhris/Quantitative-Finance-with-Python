# Quantitative Finance with Python

Programming can be used to greatly speed up and automate financial tasks. Programs in this repo explore the following concepts: 

- **pyfin**: The basics of using Python for quantitative finance: plotting historical returns, creating candlestick graphs, testing the normality assumptions, assessing volatility (Sharpe, Sortino, M2 ratios), and calculating beta
- **var-cvar**: Risk management using value at risk: historical VaR and CVaR, parametric VaR and CVaR (normal and t-distribution) of tech portfolio performance
- **mcfin**: Monte Carlo (MC) simulation: standard and vectorized versions for the MC simulation of a tech portfolio with historical VaR and CVaR, pricing a european call option in the risk neutral and continuous time setting, variance reduction with antithetic variables
